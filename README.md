# Space-Shooter
This code is a 2D Space Shooter game. The user must destroy all of the enemy spaceships by shooting them down. Players will be rewarded points as they damage and eventually kill the enemies. 

I found help from Professor Francis, Maddie McMullen, and Arcade Academy website. 

I hope to revisit this game and improve on it in later stages, this game is very basic and only accomplishes the requirements, but it's a start. I would love to figure out how to have enemy ships shoot at the player and maybe even implement levels that increase the numbers of enemies or difficulty.
